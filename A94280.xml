            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

declining them; and by this mark, ought wiſe men to chooſe their wives, for

thoſe that have it, for the moſt part to be deſirous of carnal Copulation

            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> before he fought the mortal Battle with
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, dreamed that he beheld a burning Army marching
through <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> in a <hi>Perſian</hi> Robe
at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> entering the Temple and immediately va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; laying
hold of which his Flatterers perſwaded him it preſaged the deſtruction of
the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and that <hi>Alexander</hi> being Clad in a

otherwiſe, for by the flames was denoted the ſwift and victorious

to <hi>Alexander,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire ſhould become ſubject,

<hi>Smirdis</hi> Royal-Seat, and that his Crown touched the Sky; it was
interpreted that he ſhould ſhortly die, and his Soul being free from the
incumberance of his Body, ſhould mount aloft.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xerxes</hi> upon his entering <hi>Greece</hi> with a numerous
Army, dreamt that he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Olive Branches which ſhadowed all the
Earth, it was intepreted that he ſhould be overcome by the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
and end his days in ſorrow.</p>
            <p>A Runner in the <hi>Olimpick</hi> Games dream'd <pb n="118" facs="tcp:133375:66"/>he was carried in a Chariot with four Horſes, and imparting it to
<hi>Antiphon,</hi> a wiſe man of that Age, he told him that he muſt expect
to loſe the Race, ſeeing four run before him, the Horſes by their
ſtrength, ſignifying the celerity and ability of thoſe that run before
him.</p>
            <p>A certain Perſon dreaming he ſaw an Egg hang by a ſtring at
his Bed-ſide, told it to an Interpreter, who bid him ſearch the ground
directly under that place, and he would find great riches, which he
accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did, and found as he had been told.</p>

               <hi>Ptolomy, Alexander</hi> the Great's Favourite, being wounded
with a poyſonous Arrow in a Battel againſt an <hi>Indian</hi> King,
<hi>Alexander</hi> one night dreamt, that the Dragon that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Olimpia</hi> kept, brought him a Root in his Mouth, and having delivered
it, lead him to the place where many of thoſe Roots grew, and informed him,
that by their virtue <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s wound ſhould be cured; which made
ſuch an impreſſion in his mind wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that he cauſed the place he
dream they grew in to be ſearched, and finding the Roots, experiment was

            <p>The Lord <hi>Stanly,</hi> in the time that <hi>Richard</hi> the

the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and ſo gored them with his Tusk, that the blood
ran about their ears, whereupon conſidering that the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi>
had a white Boar for his Cognizance, he conjectured that the miſchief might
proceed from him, and was ſo far poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed therewith, that he ſent
a Servant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately (it being then about midnight) to acquaint the Lord
<hi>Haſtings</hi> with his Dream, and the fears he had of the Event; as
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe further, to deſire him to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf e're Morning; which
Meſſage being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> thus replyed, Good
Lord, does your Maſter lean ſo much upon Trifles, to put ſuch Faith in
Dreams, which either his own fear fancieth, or elſe do riſe in the night by
reaſon of the days thoughts; go back therefore and recommend me to thy
Maſter, and pray him to be merry, and have no fear, for I aſſure him, I
am as ſure of the man he thinketh of as of my own hand. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the next day he loſt his Head by the commandment of the Protector, and the
Lord was dangerouſly wounded, by one amongſt divers armed men that came
into the Council-Chamber to ſlay him.</p>

Friend's houſe, but there being no more room, the other who had a
conſiderable ſum of money about him, he went to an Inn, when about Midnight
the former being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, dreamt that he ſaw his Friend ſtand by his
Bed-ſide beſeeching him to come to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, for he was ſet
upon by his Hoſt, and in danger to be ſlain. At which ſtarting, he leaps
from his Bed and made towards the Chamber-door to have gone to the Inn, but
finding it locked, and conſidering it was but a dream, he went to Bed again;
when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after falling aſleep, he dreamt he ſaw his Friend a
ſecond time all bloody, who earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſted him, that ſeeing he
had neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come and reſcue him whilſt alive, yet that he would not
be wanting to revenge-his death, ſaying he was murthered by his Hoſt, who
was carrying him out of the City in a Cart, covered with dung. Which made
ſuch an impreſſion in his mind waking, that he immediately put on his
Cloaths, the day by this time dawning, and running towards the City-gate, found
a Cartladen with dung ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, which he cauſing to be ſearched, the
dead Body of his Friend was found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the Hoſt confeſſing the

<hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife dreamt ſhe ſaw his Eye ſo put out, and warned
him of it, but neither her warning, nor <hi>Montgomery</hi>'s uſing many
endeavours to avoid the Combate, could avert his deſtiny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moriſon</hi> in his Book of Travels, relates, that whilſt he
was at <hi>Prague,</hi> he being aſleep in a Sun-ſhining morning, fancied
he ſaw an Image paſs by him, which told him his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was dead; whereat
being ſomewhat troubled, he awoke, and wrote down the hour and day, which he
put into a Box, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not on it till he came into <hi>England,</hi> and
had ſtrictly inquired the time of his Fathers death, which as near as could
be computed, agreed with his Paper.</p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice for dreams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo much
obſerved in former times, that their Interpretations were looked upon as
Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, they imagining that ſome Angelical or Divine Power more
immediately converſed with the Soul, and dictated things ſtrange and
wonderful, when it was in a manner freed from the Body, which lay diſſolved
in drowſie repoſe. Though all dreams are not to be conſidered alike for
their verity in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificrtion, for ſome proceed meerly from the action or
obſervation of the day paſt, others ill digeſtion, and aſcending
vapours, but thoſe <pb n="122" facs="tcp:133375:68"/>more eſpecially that proceed from

ſomething relating to Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, the moſt curious and nice part of

            <p>IN this particular many things are to be conſidered but chiefly
the coherence or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence of the Coeleſtial Bodies, agreeing with the

although to the operation of the Planers, we can attribute no more than the

infinite wiſe Creator, yet are they ſo placed, that in their working they
have great power over earthly things, which is moſt of all viſible by the
Sun and Moon in general, the one cauſing by kindly heat the Increaſe, and
glads with his Beams all Creatures; the other draws up the cold damps and dews,

<hi>Saturn</hi> be in the Radix of the Radix of the Flegmatick, the party is
naturally inclining to fatneſs, having dull eyes of a leady colour, being
ſlow in action, of a haughty carriage; ſtill aiming at high things, though
ſeldom ſucceeding, notwithſtanding many great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are uſed when
<hi>Saturn</hi> rules in the Nativity of the Melancholy, the countenance of the
party ſeems to be askue, or inclinable to wrineſs and deformity, appearing
of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours, the party in that caſe is ſad, <pb n="125" facs="tcp:133375:70"/>fearful, ſlovenly, and regardleſs of himſelf, unconſtant and
unfortunate: <hi>Saturn</hi> being in the Nativity of the Sanguine, makes there
a Temperament by reaſon of the Sun's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and is diſtinguiſhed or
known by the ſharpneſs of the Voice, a merry countenance, ſhining eyes,
though ſomewhat ſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet in this caſe few Sanguiniſts have
<hi>Saturn</hi> their aſcendant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jupiter</hi> Lord of the Aſcent in the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the
cholerick perſon, cauſes a whiteneſs of complection, a reddiſh or
yellowiſh Hair, a haſty temper, yet ſoon pleaſed. In the fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
perſon he cauſes a large growth, a well proportioned body, fair hair, a
high noſe, black eye-brows, and greeniſh coloured eyes. As for the
Melancholy he ſeldom is in their Nativity. The Sanguine he governs moſt,
cauſing the party to have a fine white skin, a chearful countenance, eyes a
dark brown, a high forehead, and four lines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent therein, diſpoſing
the party to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſcourſe, liberality, and a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of mind, endows him or her with wiſdom, and large fortune, and renders the
party a happy courſe of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the Aſcendant in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the

eyes, a threatning countenance, a middle ſtature, the <pb n="126" facs="tcp:133375:71"/>fore-part of the head big, the noſtrils ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, going
lightly, and taking ſhort pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of a fiery temper, given to quarrels and
diſorders. <hi>Mars</hi> in the Radix of the Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, cauſes a
yellowiſh, or rather ſomewhat inclining to a reddiſh countenance, a
middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſized viſage, ſharp eyes, a broad forehead, and a big noſe,
inclining to flatneſs, much given to diſcourſe, and inclinable to
diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Mars</hi> ruling in the Nativity of the Melancholy, cauſes
a threatning countenance, with ſundry marks on the face, or on ſome other
part of the body, the hair cheſnut-colour, the eyes large and yellow, rather
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to raſhneſs then wiſdom. If <hi>Mars</hi> be in the Sanguine
Nativity, a thing that rarely happens, it appears by flaxen hair, greeniſh
eyes, the features well compoſed, the face round, a bold reſolution, large
words, and much deſirous of great atchievements, and covetous of fame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercury</hi> is never ſeen but in three Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as thus,
if he be eminent in the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick perſon, it is known by the great
ſtature, leanneſs, and leaden-colour, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the hair, ſwift
moving, eyes deeply ſet in the head, narrow hips, and ſhort teeth. When he
is Ruler in the Nativity of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick, and there being retrograde, it
is known by the parties having ſome deformity <pb n="127" facs="tcp:133375:71"/>in his or
her Phyſiognomy, as the Noſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awry, the Mouth not even, the Eyes
aſquint and the like; as alſo by the manners of the Party, rendring unruly,
inconſtant, a great talker, and one given to many diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. When
<hi>Mercury</hi> is in the Sanguiniſts Nativity, a good diſpoſition, a
prompt wit, promiſing great riches to be obtained by ſubtility.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Sun,</hi> that being Alfridary, or Lord of the
Nativity of the Cholerick, it is known by a chearful countenance, a little
inclining to brownneſs, a comely bluſh, great eyes, much fleſhineſs and
hair, a large front, a middle ſtature, and much eloquent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> is generally ſeen in the Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Nativities,
for which reaſon ſuch are called humours, known by extraordinary
whiteneſs and ſoftneſs of the skin, intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with a little
redneſs, large and thick heads, the eye-brows joyning together, fair eyes,
but many times unequal as to the ſize, and the party ſubject to many watery
diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Venus</hi> is never but in the Flegmatick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities, known by
the fairneſs of the face, the whiteneſs of the skin, the criſping of much
hair, gentle ſpeech, black eyes, whereof the balls are ſomewhat inclining
to yellowiſh, <pb n="128" facs="tcp:133375:72"/>which burn or ſhine as it were. A Female
born under this Conſtellation, if ſhe be not married young, will ignobly
part with her honour, eſpecially if ſhe be high Noſed.</p>
            <p>And now theſe Phyſiognomies well and duly conſidered, one may
make the Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope without difficulty, taking one or more queſtions
concerning a friend that we wiſh well, and would know his preſent and

party. If ſo it fall out that they are conformable without any difference,
then paſt doubt, is he or ſhe born in the firſt Houſe of the Sign of
the Zodiack, to which that Planet relates. As for example, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be
white, have a long Noſe, fair Hair, and thick Eye-brows, a brown and
ſhining Eye, he or ſhe ſo having, is born under <hi>Venus,</hi> being
<hi>ad Inſtar,</hi> in the firſt part of <hi>Taurus,</hi> which is found to
be the firſt Houſe of that Planet, and that known in the manner
aforeſaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by way of queſtion, having well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the
month, day, hour and minute, you will paſt doubt find this Sign
<hi>Taurus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the Houſe of Life, which is the Firſt or
Tenth, called <hi>Helligiack,</hi> the Houſe of Dignities and Honour, Riches

            <p>CErtain is it, that man, according to the opinion of Ancient
Philoſophers, and Learned Men of all Ages, being a little world, that is the
Epitome of the great one, many rare and wonderful things are to be obſerved,
if ſeriouſly conſidered, but more eſpecially in theſe particulars,
for from the Nativities of either Sex, many future events derive their power
and efficacy, and fall not out, as ſome will have it, by chance, but, in a
manner, by courſe, and are liable, in a great nature, to be foreſeen,
though hardly to be prevented; for when man, intending ſo to do, uſes
divers means, and moves with great circumſpection, yet by ways he perhaps
dreams not of, many accidents and contingencies fall out between the Cradle and
the Grave, ſome happy, and ſome unhappy; and the beſt way to prevent any
danger threatned by the malignant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Planet, or other cauſes,
is with humiliation, and low proſtration, to beſeech the Supream Maker,
Governour and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all things, to avert it, who is only able, and
whoſe ſole will is fate, in whoſe power all things are, and with the
ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs obey his voice (Mankind excepted) as at his word they were
made; ſtill we ſee the Sun keeps his courſe, diſtributing to the World
light, and ſuffering darkneſs to take <pb n="134" facs="tcp:133375:75"/>its turn, the
Moon and Stars move orderly, and know their appointed times and ſeaſons,
heat and cold diſpoſſeſſes each other by turns. The Clouds give rain,
and the Earth fails not to give her Increaſe; the Fowls of the Air, the
Fiſhes of the Sea, and the Beaſt of the Field ſerve to the end for which
they were ordained, with many more too tedious to recite, when men for the
moſt refuſe to live up to that more immediate knowledge that they are
endowed withal, and improve that to their Maker's Glory, which in the end will
redound to their immortal felicity. But not to paraphraſe too long upon the
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I ſhall proceed to the propoſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. As thus,</p>
            <p>Taking the hand of the party, the day of whoſe Nativity, and what
future Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you are deſirous to make, it being that Hand on which
the lines are faireſt, for in ſome Hands by labour they are worn out, and
well marking the middle natural line where it ends (the beginning of it being
at the root of the line of Life) take notice whether there be a croſs there
or not, or that ſome other line cut it not, as alſo to what part of the
Hand they bend, for if ſo it happen that it bend and end near the Moons
mount, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the party to be born on a <hi>Monday,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
tenth of <hi>June,</hi> if there be two croſſes, <pb n="135" facs="tcp:133375:75"/>it
denotes the Birth to be on a <hi>Monday,</hi> the twentieth of <hi>June.</hi>
If a line in the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture end in the plain of <hi>Mars,</hi> with one
croſs, denotes a man born on the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> two croſſes on
the twentieth. If ſo it happen to a woman, or woman-kind, ſhe is born on
the ſame days in <hi>October.</hi> If it end toward <hi>Mercury</hi>'s mount
in the like nature, then Wedneſday, for man in <hi>May,</hi> the woman in
<hi>Auguſt.</hi> If ſo it end under the mount of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>
Thurſday is the day, and <hi>November</hi> and <hi>February</hi> the months
aſſigned. The middle line failing towards the mount of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
denotes Friday, the day in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.</hi> If the ſame
line fail towards the mount of <hi>Saturn,</hi> then is Saturday the day, and
the month <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January.</hi> If it fail towards the mount
of the <hi>Sun,</hi> it falls out on a Sunday, <hi>July</hi> being aſſigned
for the month. And ſo according to the croſſes and figures, which
frequently happen at the end of that line, according to their ſignification
may be found any day of the months already aſſigned. Now the next thing
which remains, is to know the hour, which is generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the
colour of the Eyes, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their native colour, and are not periſhed
by bruiſes, or defective by other accidents, and muſt be taken thus.</p>
            <p>If the Birth be directly about midnight, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:133375:76"/>then
will the eyes appear extream black. If at one of the clock they will be
ſomewhat ſhining. At two of the clock the party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born, the eyes will
have ſomewhat of a dark green in them, with dusky balls. Thoſe that are
born at four will be greeniſh, but the green a little lighter, inclining to
an Olive-colour. After four or at five the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being born, the Apples
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the eyes will incline to
a whitiſh, though ſomewhat rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a bluiſh. The party born at or
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſix and ſeven, will have the apples of his eyes half blue, and the
remainder a kind of a wall colour. The party born at or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eight and nine
hath the circuit of the centre of the apple blue, and the centre of a
party-colour. At or between ten and eleven the party born has the eyes all
blue, with a few marks. At twelve they begin to be ſomewhat greeniſh,
though much ſhining. At or between one and two in the afternoon the party
being born, has eyes between blue and green. At or between three or four they
are of a pale green. At or between ſeven or eight they are coloured
yellowiſh, with ſome ſmall matter of green. At or between nine and ten
they have red ſpots in them, though being of the ſame colour with thoſe
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately foregoing. The party born at or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eleven and twelve, are as
for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <pb n="137" facs="tcp:133375:76"/>hour, ſomewhat inclinable to
redneſs, but from that time blacken to the twelfth.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the hours of Night and Day, in every one of which
throughout the year, either Male or Female, if not both, are born; and although
it cannot be poſitively affirmed to be an infallible ſign, yet, it is
wonderfully to be obſerved, ſeldom failing the party in his Judgement, who
makes due inquiry.</p>
            <p>As for the year, if we have regard to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romancy, in that caſe it
is known divers ways, as by the lines of the Wriſt, Forehead; as for the
Wriſt, the lines ſignifies thirties of years, but as age increaſes
thoſe lines are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, decreaſing by little and little, as if the
firſt line be half extinct, then ſhows it, that the party is fifteen years
of age, and to be quite extinct thirty; four lines in the Wriſt being
generally the moſt, though ſome have five, and by an equal meaſure in
this caſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny year may be known, by dividing a whole line into thirty
parts, a half line into fifteen, and ſo to the quarter, or almoſt
extinction or end.</p>

            <figure/>
            <p>As for Age it's likewiſe ſeen in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and this by the
Rule of Metapoſcopy, and on the firſt year appear but to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
year, when upon the left ſide extending to or towards the Temple from the
Ear, there is a little line which denotes that age, and if it deſcend to the
Forehead, it denotes the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be between ten and twelve years of age; if
it ſo fall out, that it is apparent in cutting through the Forehead, it
ſignifies the party to be in the twenty fifth year, and according to its
length, the years under twenty five are to be gueſſed or imagined,
according to the Rule of this Art and Science. If there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear conſiderably
divided, thirty years are ſignified, and from five and twenty to thirty, 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:133375:77"/>according to the length of the third. If there happen a
fourth, it ſignifies by its length, forty, fifty, ſixty, ſeventy, and
eighty years, eſpecially if there happen another half line on the right
ſide the Forehead, but beyond this, or eſpecially exceeding five; they are
referred to the Alfridaries, and cannot, or at leaſt but with great
uncertainty, in this caſe be known, but is better underſtood by wrinkles or
lines in the extremities of the Eyes, reckoning twenty years to every line, and
equally for the reſt, though in young people, eſpecially of the Female Sex,
theſe rarely, unleſs they laugh or frown much, and then you muſt take
heed leſt you are deceived, by taking thoſe for lines that are none, but

to prevent diſeaſes that may, by their continuance, be contracted.</p>
            <p>If the Senſes appear dull and melancholy, without affliction or

turns, the breath ſhort, and fetched with pain, and pain in the head; if
theſe Symptoms in any critical <pb n="142" facs="tcp:133375:79"/>time happen, they denote
a conflict of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Sickneſs approaching through Eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>If the Eyes are dull, and Rheum much afflict them, if the Noſtrils
are red, if the Midriff and ſhort Ribs ſtretch without pain, if the Breath
be difficult, a pain of the Head, Noſe, and Face, itching pain of the

precious, which ſhall turn to their great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. If born on the eleventh

deſirous of labour, nor thoughtful of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. If on the twentieth day,
it denotes the party from a low ſtation to riſe to a high degree. If one
the twenty-firſt day the party is promiſed riches by Navigation. If on the

Dropſie and Gout are threatned. If on the twenty fifth day, bad ſucceſs
is predicted, in eſpecially Rural Affairs. And ſo for the twenty-ſixth,
and twenty-ſeventh; for ſo many days, beſides hour and minutes, is the
Sun making her progreſs through the Twelve Signs of the Zodiack, as being the
neareſt Planet to the Earth, ſo that to her are more immediately attributed
the rule of all watery Bodies, ſhe drawing after her in her Riſes and Fall,
not only the Ocean and the Blood in the Body of Mankind, and other Creatures of

Houſe, the affair will be proſperous if begun at that time, and the party
have ſucceſs. If any perſon make a Voyage when the Moon is in the fifth
Houſe it will be proſperous, but if <hi>Mars</hi> be there, let him expect
to ſuffer much by ſtorms, and may be in danger of caſting away. And ſo
if any one ſicken, <hi>Saturn</hi> or the <hi>Moon</hi> being in the eighth
houſe, termed the Houſe of Death, the recovery is to be doubted, if you
contract Friendſhip, the <hi>Moon</hi> being in the third, which is the
Houſe attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Friends and Relations, it will be to your great
advantage, prove happy and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but if <hi>Mercury</hi> be there, the
contrary. The firſt Houſe is termed the Aſcendant of the Horoſcope,
whence is gathered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man's life, wherefore to undertake any
buſineſs when <hi>Jupiter</hi> or the <hi>Moon</hi> is there will prove
very fortunate. If <hi>Jupiter</hi> be Lord <pb n="155" facs="tcp:133375:85"/>of the
Nativity in that Houſe, honours and great preferments are promiſed. The
<hi>Moon</hi> being in the fourth Houſe at the Nativity, called the houſe
of Inheritance and Treaſure, the party ſhall have an eſtate fall
unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. If a Woman conceive when <hi>Venus</hi> is in the fifth Houſe,
the Child will be Male. If in the ſixth, a weak female Child. If
<hi>Mercury,</hi> &amp; <hi>Venus</hi> be at the time of the conception in
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in the 5th houſe, there happen twins, or if but one, it proves
for the moſt part to be a Hermophrodite, participating of either Sex.
Buſineſs begun, the <hi>Moon</hi> being in the 12th. Houſe, ſhall meet
with many croſſes and diſappointments, going for the moſt part
prepoſterouſly. If a party be born when the <hi>Sun</hi> is in the ninth
Houſe, and <hi>Mercury</hi> be Lord of his Nativity, he ſhall travel into
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange Lands, advance himſelf thereby, and increaſe in wiſdom
and piety, dying in his Native-Countrey in a good old-Age. If a party is born,
the <hi>Moon</hi> being in the tenth Houſe, and the <hi>Sun</hi> the
ſeventh, <hi>Mars</hi> being Lord of that Nativity, good ſucceſs is
promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Rural Affairs, but in other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the party will be
unfortunate. The party born when the <hi>Moon</hi> is in the twelfth Houſe,
and <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the Nativity, is born to diſcontent, diſorder,
ſtrife and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. In fine, the Houſes have theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:133375:86"/>attributed to them, in caſe the Planet, that is, Lord of
the Nativity, be in one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, as that it muſt conſequently.
The firſt houſe ſo termed, is the Horoſcope or Aſcendant from whence
the condition and manner of life is reſolved. The ſecond is the Houſe of
Riches, Servants, Subſtance, as al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo the expiration of youth. The third is
that of Brothers, Siſters, and Kindred far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of. The fourth is that of
Inheritance and Poſſeſſions. The fifth is that of Children, Pleaſure,
Delights, Subſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſixth is that of Sickneſs and
Health. The ſeventh is that of Wedlock, Contractions, Marriages, happy and
unhappy breaches of Love, miſtruſt, and the like. The eight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes of
what kind of death the party ſhall die, and what befals him in his latter
days. The ninth is that of Piety, Wiſdom, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Philoſophy and Travel,
as well in Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at Seas, as by Journeys by Land. The renth is that of
Government, Advancement, Learning Eminency, Lordſhips, Laws, and has great
Influence on the middle part of the life. The eleventh is that of Benefactors,
Friends, Servants, and the like, much influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing old Age. The twelfth and
laſt is that of Enemies ſighting, Labour, Envy, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and falls upon
the latter end of man's days. Now from theſe the Queſtion rightly 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:133375:86"/>ſtated, the hour and minute of the Nativity, the
conſtitution and complection of the party rightly conſidered, may be drawn
ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures as to health, ſickneſs long or ſhort life,
marriages, happy or unhappy voyages, travel, children, friends, riches,
proſperity in one place more than in another, and the like. And indeed this
is the foundation on which all the pretenders to ſuch Solutions build and
draw their Inferences, from which many times come exactly to paſs, though
ſometimes the expectations of the Inquiſitive are left in the miſt of
Ambiguity.</p>

Houſes proper to other Planets, by reaſon their proper Houſes being more
natural to them, they pour not out their malign influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that degree as is
other caſes. As for the rule of the Planets, by turns, they are theſe: On

<hi>Sol.</hi> The fifth <hi>Venus.</hi> The ſixth <hi>Mercury.</hi> The

<hi>Jupiter</hi> Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. <hi>Venus</hi> Friday. <hi>Saturn</hi> Saturday. And
their diſpoſitions are theſe: <hi>Saturn</hi> cauſes a firm and

            <p>Another underſtanding of this Wheel, is thus, Chuſe a number

Divine and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THough this to ſome may ſeem ſtrange, yet may it not
altogether prove unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, being drawn from Reaſon, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and
particular Obſervations, as likewiſe from the Opinions of the Learned.
Firſt, Then I ſhall thus proceed, that amongſt all Creatures in Heaven
and Earth, ſome are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and others corporal, by the ſpiritual is
meant thoſe that have no body or viſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as Angels and the
Souls of Men; now in this caſe ſome have life, and others not, ſome are
laſting and immutable, others pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable and corruptible, ſome motion,
and thers without motion; and amongſt thoſe which are without life. there
is difference in two points, ſome have natural motion, the reſt want it;
and amongſt thoſe which have this motion, ſome are mutable, corruptible,
and ſubject to change, the reſt not perſiſting <pb n="169" facs="tcp:133375:92"/>always in their Eſtate, during the courſe of this World, ſtones
and metals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of the number of thoſe that have neither
life, nor any natural moving whatſoever, but participate with the Stable
Earth. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Air, and Fire, are Creatures, the which, though wanting
life, yet have the motion, and are ſubject to all corruption, as are all
other Creatures compoſed of Elements, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they retain life or not; for
by reaſon they are compounded of matter, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualities, they do at
length corrupt, and are changed; not in regard of the firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and
ſubſtance, which periſhes not, tho it changeth Forms, but returneth
always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Element, whereof every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound conſiſteth, and
notwithſtanding, ſtones and metals are exceeding hard, yet are they not
Exempt from corruption, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by Uſage; but the Celeſtial
Bodies conſiſts of ſuch matter, nature and ſubſtance, that being in
perpetual motion, they ever perſevere, and are intire in their firſt form,
not being ſubject to change in Bodies, or any way conſuming like other
Creatures that are under them.</p>
            <p>As for the matter and ſubſtance of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies, it
has occaſioned divers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes amongſt the Learned, for ſome, even
<hi>Phyloſophers,</hi> have affirmed, that the Heavens <pb n="170" facs="tcp:133375:93"/>and Stars are compounded of the ſame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with other Creatures,
though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refined and purged from its groſneſs; rendring this
reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that they could not be viſible, were they not made of
viſible matter, and that it is unlikely that viſible things ſhould be
made of things inviſible; from whence they conclude, that there is in the
compoſition of Celeſtial Bodies, ſome portion of Earth and Water, and
that they are more lucid and bright, they attribute to the nature of the Air
and Fire; others are of Opinion, that the Heavens are compoſed of another
nature of ſubſtance, which they term the fifth Eſſence, of moſt rare
and different ſubſtance, from the Elementary, and much more excellent and
noble; but whatſoever may be ſubtilly invented in this matter, it may be
very well conjectured, that heat is the ſubſtance of ſubſiſtance of
Celeſtial Bodies, which is inſeperable from brightneſs, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
and ſemblance of light having the ſubſtance of it, and of heat, ſo
annexed with it ſelf, that it is almoſt nothing elſe, ſo that the light
brightneſ;, and heat, may be taken for one and the ſame thing the
ſubſtance and matter of Heaven and of all the Spheres, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they
more wearied, worn, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted for all the labour they have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by
the ſpace of ſo many thouſand years, <pb n="171" facs="tcp:133375:93"/>than they were
the firſt day of their Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for we muſt not hold it for a change and
alteration of their natures and qualities in that, according to their divers
courſes, the Stars and Planets are ſometimes far from, and ſometimes
nearer to each other, and that they have conjunctions, oppoſitions, and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers aſpects, according to the variety of their motions; not yet for the
Eclipſe of the Sun, occaſioned by the interpoſition of the Moon's dark
Body, between us and that glorious light, or of the Moon by the interpoſition
of the ſhadow of the Earth, between the Sun and her lightneſs, or be, for
ſuch changes are not in their proper Bodies ſubſtance and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but
only in regard of us and our ſight, though in the end they ſhall wax old
like a Garment, and paſs away; but till that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, ſealed up
from the knowledge of all Men or Angels, in the Boſom of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom,
they ſhall keep their courſe without alteration.</p>

            </argument>
            <figure/>
            <p>THE Generation of the fiery Impreſſion oft ſeen in the Air,
called burning Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or ſparkles of Fire, is on this kind, <hi>viz.</hi>
When the matter of the Exhalation being an Unctious or Oily Vapour extracted
from the Earth, by the influence of the Stars, or Beams of the Sun into the
higheſt Region, and there being in all parts alike thin, one part takes fire
before the other can arrive, ſo kindled by degrees, it flies abroad like
ſparkles, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Stars.</p>
            <p>The flying Dragon, or fiery Drake, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="173" facs="tcp:133375:94"/>ſort of fiery Meteors, is a Body of a vaporous matter, aſcending
to the Region of cold, but by reaſon of its groſneſs, not capable to
paſs it; ſo that being driven down by the vehementneſs of its agitation,
takes fire, forming it ſelf into the ſhape of a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, very fearful to
behold, and in the like nature are generated and kindled fires in the Air,
reſembling Shields, Globes, Bowels, Lamps, Pyramids, and the like, according
as they fall into faſhion, by reaſon of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they meet, or
their ſooner or later kindling.</p>
            <p>There is a Light ſeen upon the Earth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Will with the
Wiſh,</hi> which in Mooriſh or Marſhy ground, is ſeen to go before men
in a dark Night, called by the Latins, <hi>Ignis Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> or fooliſh
fire, which is indeed no other but a Vapour kindled by vehement agitation,
moving and skipping up &amp; down by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or direction of the Air, when
through the darkneſs of the Night, men many times fixing their eyes upon it;
they are ſo dazled as they looſe their way, which they fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attribute to the power of this Vapour, which indeed has no ſuch
operation.</p>
            <p>There are other flames which appear upon mens beards &amp; hair, as
likewiſe upon Beaſt's, theſe are cauſed by clammy Vapours ſcattered
in the Air, and taking fire by their ſwift and <pb n="174" facs="tcp:133375:95"/>vehement
motion which ingenders ſuch heat, that in motion many times Arrows have taken
fire, and Bullets have melted.</p>
            <p>Comets or Blazing-Stars are no other than a huge Maſs of vaporous
Unctions, which by reaſon of its ſubtilty reaches the Region of Fire, and
there blazes till the matter that feeds it is conſumed: the Train or Tail
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blaze, and the round Head the Body of Fire that continues it, and
cannot be ſeen, where the Sun beams make any impreſſion, but is very
diſcernable when the ſhadow of the Earth paſſes about it; but for the
moſt part theſe Exhalations threaten mankind with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Calamities,
appearing as the Beacons of Heaven, to warn the ſinful World to repent.</p>

            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:133375:95"/>
            <p>THE cauſe of many Suns and Moons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at once, that is the
repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many, though indeed not real, is, as to the firſt, when
the Sun caſts a full reflex upon ſmooth and watery Clouds, and in them
impreſſes its likeneſs, ſo that ſometimes there appear two, three, or
five Suns in this nature ſo are produced the Images of many ſmall Suns like
little Stars, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are produced the Images of the Moon, ſeen
oftner than the former, by reaſon of her nearneſs to the Earth.</p>
            <p>Lightning is cauſed by a hot Vapour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the Earth
and Water, which in its Aſcenſion taking fire, yet not being able to break
through the cold Region, it forces its paſſages downward, when meeting with
watery cold, it plunges into them, and rend them in pieces with horrible
Bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is called Thunder, but when no Clouds interpoſe, or at
leaſt very thin ones, then are flaſhes of Lightning only ſeen, but no
Thunder heard; the reaſon why the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is ſo long ſeen before the
Thunder is heard is, for that the ſence of ſeeing, is more quick and
inſtant than that of hearing.</p>
            <p>Earthquakes are cauſed by Winds in the Bowels or hollow Caverns of
the Earth, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the heat and oppoſition they meet 
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:133375:96"/>with, ſo that ſtruggling for vent, they often in
forcing their way, rend and force the Earth in ſunder, and fly forth in
prodigious Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, doing great miſchief. Whirlwinds, properly termed
ſo, is cauſed by a ſtrong Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, or Airy Contraction that forces its
way through a flock of Clouds, without any noiſe of Thunder, of flaſh of
Lightning. Another ſort there are, called fiery Whirlwinds, which is when a
Vapour in ſuch a caſe takes fire, which ſort overthrows and deſtroys
all dry things that oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>Circles about the Sun and Moon are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the thick and
groſneſs of the Air, for the Beams being ſhot direct, reverberate, or are
beaten back, making a round Circle or Halen, according to the roundneſs of
the body of Light which occaſions it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſo falleth out
through the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of thin Clouds.</p>
            <p>The Rain bow is cauſed by the Suns. Beams, darting aſcance, or
in oppoſition to a thick and watery Cloud, making the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours lighter or
darker, according to the deepneſs of their penetration.</p>
            <p>The natural Winds are cauſed by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and violent motion
of the Air, and that directed from the turning of the Spheres more or leſs
according, and the reaſon why it ſo often varies and changes, is to purge
off, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:133375:96"/>and carry away the groſs Vapours, which would
otherways infect the Earth, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, and render it uninhabitable.</p>
            <p>Rain is cauſed by Miſty Vapours exhaled by the heat of the Sun,
which being drawn up, thicken, and are carried about by the Winds, till they
are too heavy, and then fall down in ſhowers; for the Clouds are of no
ſolid matter, but only compoſed of moiſt and dry Vapours, and where it
ſo falls out that the Wind is exceeding ſcant before the moiſt Vapour can
aſcend to its height or thicken, then does it fall again in Miſt.</p>
            <p>Hail and Snow are moiſt Vapours, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by too near approaching
the Region of cold. If the Vapour be thick, then it is Hail or Driſle, if
thin and expanded, then it is Snow; if thin and cloſe Rime or hoar Froſt.

               <p> Of the perfect Compoſition which are in the Nature of things,
by which the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be conſidered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS for the four Elements, they may be fitly termed to reſemble
living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Plants, Stones and Metals, as for Stones 
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:133375:97"/>they have their Original and Foundation from the Earth,
and agreeing with its nature, ever deſcend. Metal may be ſaid to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon the ſecond Watery Angle of the World, as agreeing in their Liquid Matter
with Water, all Metals have their Original from Quickſilver and Sulphur,
ſtewed or boyled in the Bowels of the Earth, and are finer or courſer,
according to the firmneſs or groſneſs of thoſe Originals, upon the
third or Airy Angle of the World. We may find Plants, for they neither grow nor
fructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, but in the open-day, and do properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the nature of Air,
which they always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as being fitteſt and apteſt for them. Upon the
fourth Angle, namely Fire, may be centered or put all living Creatures, whoſe
lives as the Learned hold, ſubſiſt by fire, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Empireal
Heaven and Spirit of Life, which is a quickning fire, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth Life
to all the Wheels of the World.</p>
            <p>True it is, that under every Univerſal kind of theſe, there are
divers particular ſpecies diſtinct the one from the other; for although
ſtones may properly enough be termed Earthy, yet are they ſometimes
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated of ſome other Element, which moſt prevaileth in their
compoſition for doubtleſs all the Elements do meet together in the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation of them, but chiefly Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <pb n="179" facs="tcp:133375:97"/>and
may by their groſneſs or pureneſs be obſerved, which moſt
predominates or contributed to the compoſition, for the dark ſtones are
called earthly; and the clear ones watery. As for Metals, they participate
moſtly of a watery ſubſtance, though they have in them the compoſition
of all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and may be reſembled to the ſeven Planets, as Gold to
the Sun, Silver to the Moon, Iron to <hi>Mars,</hi> Quickſilver to
<hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> Braſs to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Lead to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and
Tin to <hi>Venus,</hi> being each of them imagined to have the fire or
influence of the ſaid Planets. As for Plants, although they may be by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Airy; yet there are ſome whoſe Roots, Leaves and Bloſſoms are hot in
the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, others are cold and dry, ſome are moiſt, which
diverſity happeneth according as the Plant participateth, more or leſs of
the ſundry Elements. The like is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of living Creatures for
although they are ſaid to participate of the Region or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fire, yet
the compoſition of all the Elements are found in them, and without them no
Creature can ſubſiſt; nay, divers are of Opinion, that all the glittering
Frame of Nature, as well Celeſtial as Terreſtrial, has a participation,
though more ratified and refined. And thus Reader, I hope to your
ſatisfaction, I have performed my promiſed <pb n="180" facs="tcp:133375:98"/>Task,
though but ſmall to the eye, yet a work large to the mind, and not without
much ſerious deliberation, eaſily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. As for the pains I have
taken here I exact no applauſe, but if advantage accrue hereby, give the
glory to God, who is the only Omnipotent Wiſe Creator, and diſpoſes of
all things, and in whom all Created Beings are centered.</p>
